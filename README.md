# Project: DREAMWORK
To try and create a Multiplayer 3D ARPG that has the combination of gameplay mechanics/systems that I feel it is unique from games that I've played throughout the years. Learning Unity as I progress in my journey in creating this game during the free time that I have and hopefully it can be a dream come true to play this game with my friends.
